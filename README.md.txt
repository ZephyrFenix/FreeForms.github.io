FreeForms is a javascript based program meant to be used to create forms for different purposes. This could be as simple as a grocery list, or as complicated as a character sheet for a tabletop rpg.

The card is where the magic happens, it's what becomes your sheets. You can add new cards and remove them. If you remove the last card from a group, the group will automatically delete itself. You can also create new groups of cards to keep organized. If you accidentally create too many elements, cards or groups you can remove them with the '-' buttons. The only button that functions at the moment along the top bar is the New button, which will restore the default setup of FreeForms.

Future versions will include:
Save to JSON and Load from JSON feature
Multiple types of elements to add to the cards
Ability to change the header background color
Element and Card interaction
